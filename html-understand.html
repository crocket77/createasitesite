    <h1>How to build a website</h1>
    <h2>Steps to take:</h2>
    <h3>Downloads</h3>
        <p>You need to download an software that compiles code or an IDE like Microsoft Visualk
        Once downloaded, open Microsoft Visual and create a folder somewhere on your computer.
        With that folder open in Visual create a file within it with the ending .html. like so: webstie.html
    
        </p>
    <h3>HTML file</h3>
        <p>Once you have your file open without any other text in the file enter an exlamation
            point "!" and press "enter". This is a shortcut to get code for your website to run properly.
            This code will not be seen on your website.
            
            *You can put a '< style> < /'style>'section inside the d.html file and put CSS inside or create a separate CSS file. 
        </p>
