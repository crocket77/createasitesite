    i wrote this in the &lthead&gt&lt/head&gt section
</head>

<body>
    <h1>&lth1&gtHow to build a website&lt/h1&gt</h1>
    <p> I formated h1 with: h1{color: red; text-decoration: underline;} in the style section</p>
    <h2>&lth2&gtSteps to take:&lt/h2&gt</h2>
    <h3>&lth3&gtDownloads&lt/h3&gt</h3>
        <p>&ltp&gtYou need to download an software that compiles code or an IDE like Microsoft Visualk
        Once downloaded, open Microsoft Visual and create a folder somewhere on your computer.
        With that folder open in Visual create a file within it with the ending .html. like so: webstie.html&lt/p&gt
        </p>
    <h3>&lth3&gtHTML file&lt/h3&gt</h3>
        <p>&ltp&gtOnce you have your file open without any other text in the file enter an exlamation
            point "!" and press "enter". This is a shortcut to get code for your website to run properly.
            This code will not be seen on your website.
        <div>&ltdiv&gt&lt/div&gt</div>    
            *You can put a style section by typing "style" between &ltstyle&gt &lt/style&gt section inside the .html file and put CSS 
            inside or create a separate CSS file. 
        <div>&ltdiv&gt&lt/div&gt</div>
            Note:To get that carated style in the previous sentance i had to use & followed by lt for &lt and gt for &gt.
            HTML recognizes the carats as code when I am typing them in to explain them to you. It is a little more difficult to leave 
            notes.&lt/p&gt
        </p>
